# Roborock Custom Map

you MUST be on 2025.4b or later

This allows you to use the core Roborock integration with the [Xiaomi Map Card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card)

### Setup

1. Install the [Roborock Core Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=roborock) and set it up
2. It is recommended that you first disable the Image entities within the core integration. Open each image entity, hit the gear icon, then trigger the toggle by enabled.
3. Install this integration(See the installing via HACS section below)
4. This integration works by piggybacking off of the Core integration, so the Core integration will do all the data updating to help prevent rate-limits. But that means that the core integration must be setup and loaded first. If you run into any issues, make sure the Roborock integration is loaded first, and then reload this one.
5. Setup the map card like normal! An example configuration would look like
```yaml
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
vacuum_platform: Roborock
entity: vacuum.s7
map_source:
  camera: image.s7_downstairs_full_custom
calibration_source:
  camera: true
```
### Map rotation (new)

If your map is displayed sideways or upside down, you can rotate the map directly in Home Assistant.

This integration provides a **Select entity per map** to control rotation:
- `select.<...>_rotation`
- Options: `0°`, `90°`, `180°`, `270°` (labels depend on your HA language)

This rotates **both**:
- the map image
- and the calibration points used by the Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card  
  (so rooms/zones and interactions stay aligned after rotation)

**How to use**
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Roborock Custom Map**
2. Open the device/entities list
3. Find the `… rotation` select entity for your map and choose the correct rotation

No reload is required; the map updates immediately.

6. You can hit Edit on the card and then Generate Room Configs to allow for cleaning of rooms. It might generate extra keys, so check the yaml and make sure there are no extra 'predefined_sections'

### Q7 / SC05 support (v0.2.0+)

Devices like `roborock.vacuum.sc05` (Q8) use the B01/Q7 protocol: the map is **not** pushed,
it has to be fetched on request (`service.get_map_list` + `service.upload_by_mapid`).
For these devices the integration creates a single `..._custom_map_q7` image entity
that polls the map every 30 seconds and exposes:

- the rendered map image (`camera:` source in the Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card),
- `room_names` and `calibration_points` attributes (derived from the SCMap header)
  for the card overlays.

Known limitation: `calibration_points` for Q7 is computed from the SCMap header and
has not been verified against a live payload yet — check the map card overlays and
adjust if the robot position/rooms are off.

## Installation

### Installing via HACS
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Lash-L&repository=RoborockCustomMap&category=integration)

or

1. Go to HACS->Integrations
1. Add this repo(https://github.com/Lash-L/RoborockCustomMap) into your HACS custom repositories
1. Search for Roborock Custom Map and Download it
1. Restart your HomeAssistant
1. Go to Settings->Devices & Services
1. Add the Roborock Custom Map integration

### Alternative/optional

Once you set up this integration, you can generate a static config in the lovelace card, and theoretically, you should be able to use that code with your Roborock CORE integration. However, it wont stay up to date if the map calibrations change significantly, or rooms change. So I'd only do this when I was sure everything was good!
